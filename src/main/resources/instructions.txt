 army of Techbots have taken control of
earth's largest city.  Once a respected
    genius and scientist, Dr. Proton
 (he changed his name from Blunderwitz
 early in his career) decided he could
   rule earth with a new world order.

After a terrible radiation accident that
 altered his brain, Dr. Proton took to
 the underworld and developed an army
 of advanced robots -- called Techbots.
  The Techbots are extremely dangerous,
 and guard Dr. Proton's secret hideout.
    Every attempt by the military to
 overcome Dr. Proton ended in disaster.
   It seems Dr. Proton's plan to rule
        Earth is well underway...

         IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Duke Nukum needs food and soft drinks
to keep him health!  Grab all the food
and drinks you can find (sometimes
hidden in boxes).

Duke is armed with a CIA prototype
Nuclear Pistol, which has proved to be
extremely powerful in field tests. Let's
hope it works in an actual mission!

Dr. Proton has built several nuclear
reactors to provide power for all of
his Techbots and traps.  Duke should
consider destroying these reactors a
high priority.

It's possible that Duke will find many
useful objects.  For example, keys can
open doors, boots can help Duke jump
higher, and extra pistols will increase
Duke's firepower.

         IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Duke has unlimited chances (lives) to
complete his mission, but every time
Duke dies he will have to restart the
current level from the beginning.  Duke
should consume drinks and food to keep
his health high.

Each level Duke completes will bring
him closer to finding Dr. Proton.  But
Dr. Proton will watch Duke's every move
with an advanced security system (notice
the video cameras that follow your every
move!).  Destroying every camera on a
level will earn you a secret bonus.
There are several other secret bonuses
you might discover.

You can only save and restore Duke's
progress in the small hallways between
levels.  Hint:  You should save after
each level you complete.

             Press any key.
